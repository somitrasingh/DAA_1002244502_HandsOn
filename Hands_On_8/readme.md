1. Leverage your implementation of quicksort to implement the ith order statistic. Demonstrate it's working via an example. Upload your code to github.
Solution:
The 4th smallest element is: 7
quickSort.py

2. Implement and upload your source code to github for: stack, queue, and singly linked list. Make sure to implement the same functionality (api/interface)
as the ones from the book.  *Restriction*: Use fixed sized arrays (C style arrays) and assume only integers (C style int) for the data to store.

Solution:

stack.py
Stack Overflow
Stack: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Popped: 5
Top element: 4
Stack: [1, 2, 3, 4]

queue.py
Queue Overflow
Queue: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Dequeued: 1
Front element: 2
Queue: [2, 3, 4, 5]

singleLinkedList.py
Linked List: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Deleted from beginning: 1
Deleted from end: 5
Linked List: [2, 3, 4]
