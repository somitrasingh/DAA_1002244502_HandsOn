### Hash Table Implementation Overview

This project demonstrates a Python-based hash table designed with the following key features:

- **Hash Function**: Incorporates both multiplication and division techniques to hash integer keys, with the option to customize the hash function for flexibility.
- **Key-Value Storage**: Supports integer keys and values, storing them efficiently.
- **Collision Resolution**: Uses chaining with a doubly linked list to handle collisions, ensuring smooth insertion and retrieval of key-value pairs.
- **Dynamic Resizing**: Automatically adjusts its size by doubling when it becomes full and halving when 75% of its capacity is free, ensuring optimal space usage.
- **Array Simulation**: Simulates C-style arrays using Python lists for bucket storage.
- **Basic Operations**: Provides core methods for inserting, retrieving, and removing elements, along with the ability to check the number of elements and the current bucket count.
