### Overview

This project implements a Min Heap data structure in Python. A Min Heap is a binary tree where each parent node is smaller than or equal to its children, making it efficient for priority queue operations.

### Heap operations:
Adding new elements into the heap.    
Removing the root element and adding the heap property.  
obtaining the heap's root element without removal.  
creating a min-heap out of a random or unsorted array.
